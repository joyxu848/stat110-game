Actually, there are only 29 stories. Label the floors (stories) of the building $1,2, \dots, 29$, from lowest to highest, so floor $1$ is at the ground level and floor $29$ is the top floor. An elevator has just been installed in Wayside School. However, the builder forgot to put buttons in the elevator. The builder said he was very sorry. 

\medskip

\noin The elevator randomly ``chooses"" which floor to stop at, following a Markov chain. On each step of the chain, the elevator either goes down 2 floors, down 1 floor, up 1 floor, or up 2 floors (or whichever of these are possible). 

\medskip

\noin For example, if the elevator is currently stopped at floor $22$, then its next stop will be at floor 20, 21, 23, or 24. If the elevator is currently stopped at floor $1$, then its next stop will be at floor 2 or 3 (since there is no floor $-1$ or $0$). On each step, the elevator ``chooses"" among the possible next stops with equal probabilities. 

\medskip

\noin The elevator starts at floor $1$; call this the $0$th stop. Let $X_n$ be the floor of the $n$th stop of the elevator. So $X_0 = 1$, and $P(X_1 = 2) = 1/2 = P(X_1 = 3).$

","\noin 1. Frida is in love with Prue but doesn't know whether Prue returns her feelings. Luckily, Frida's brother Fred does know. Unable to stand the suspense any longer, Frida texts Fred to ask whether Prue loves her or only likes her as a friend. Fred replies, \nobreak ``TRUE LORE"". 

\medskip

\noin When Fred types a letter he types it correctly with probability $p$, and makes a typo with probability $q = 1-p$. If he makes a typo, the typed letter is equally likely to be any of the $25$ possible wrong letters. (For simplicity, ignore capitalization.) The typed letters are conditionally independent given what message Fred intended to send.

\medskip

\noin Suppose that Fred intended to send Frida one of the following three possible messages: ``TRUE LOVE"", ``PRUE LOVE"", or ``PRUE LIKE"". The prior probabilities (unconditional, before knowing what text he actually sent) are $1/3$ for each of these messages. Fred would intend to send one of the first two of these three messages if and only if Prue loves Frida.

\medskip 

\noin (a) Find the probability that Prue loves Frida, given the above information. To simplify calculations, you can express your answer in terms of $p,q,$ and $c$, where $c=1/25$. 

\vspace{4.35in}

\noin (b) It turns out that Fred is a careful typist; he doesn't like having to be corrected by his sister or his best friend, both of whom are proofreaders. So $q$ is small. Give an intuitive explanation in words for what the probability from (a) should approximately be in this case.

This problem studies such coincidences. According to data from the Social Security Administration, for babies born in the U.S.~in the years 2000--2009 the most common first name was Jacob, and the proportion that were named Jacob is between $0.0065$ and $0.0066$. Let $k$ be the number of first names represented among these babies. Label these names as name 1, name 2, \dots, name $k$, in alphabetical order. (So these are the $k$ different names that at least one of these babies has.) Let $p_j$ be the proportion of these babies that have name $j$.

\medskip

\noin Consider a group of $n$ people, with $n \geq 3$. Their first names were chosen randomly from the $k$ names described above, with name $j$ having probability $p_j$. Their names are independent. Find a good approximation for the probability that, among the $n$ people, there are three (or more) people with the same first name. (Your answer should be in terms of $n,p_1,\dots,p_k$.)
